        <h2>Return Policy</h2>
        <p>Complete Health Peptides maintains a strict no-return, no-refund policy for all purchases. This policy is in place due to the nature of our research products and our commitment to maintaining quality control and integrity in our supply chain.</p>
        
        <h3>Why We Don't Accept Returns</h3>
        <p>As a provider of specialized research compounds, we cannot accept returns for the following reasons:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Quality assurance and product integrity concerns</li>
          <li>Potential contamination issues with returned products</li>
          <li>Strict regulatory compliance requirements</li>
          <li>Inability to verify proper storage and handling of returned items</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Product Quality Guarantee</h3>
        <p>While we do not accept returns or provide refunds, we are committed to providing high-quality research products. All our products undergo rigorous quality control testing and are shipped with certificates of analysis to verify their purity and composition.</p>
        
        <h3>Damaged or Incorrect Orders</h3>
        <p>In the rare event that you receive a product that was damaged during shipping or an incorrect product was sent, please contact our customer service team within 48 hours of delivery with photographic evidence of the issue. These situations will be handled on a case-by-case basis, but please note that replacement, not refund, is the standard resolution.</p>
